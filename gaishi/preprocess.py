    """
    Preprocess genomic data to generate feature vectors for machine learning models.

    This function orchestrates the preprocessing pipeline by initializing a genomic data generator
    and a feature vector preprocessor. It utilizes multiprocessing to efficiently process large
    genomic datasets, generating feature vectors based on the specified configuration.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vcf_file : str
        Path to the VCF file containing genomic variants.
    chr_name : str
        Name of the chromosome to process.
    ref_ind_file : str
        Path to the file listing reference individual identifiers.
    tgt_ind_file : str
        Path to the file listing target individual identifiers.
    win_len : int
        Length of the sliding window for analysis, in base pairs.
    win_step : int
        Step size for the sliding window, in base pairs.
    feature_config_file : str
        Path to the YAML configuration file specifying the features to be computed.
    output_dir : str
        Directory where output files will be saved.
    output_prefix : str, optional
        Prefix for the output files generated by the preprocessor. Default: 'lr'.
    nprocess : int, optional
        Number of worker processes to use for parallel processing. Default: 1.
    ploidy : int, optional
        Ploidy of the samples, typically 2 for diploid organisms. Default: 2.
    is_phased : bool, optional
        Indicates whether the genomic data is phased. Default: True.
    anc_allele_file : str, optional
        Path to the file containing ancestral allele information. Default: None.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If any of the provided parameters are invalid, such as negative window lengths or step sizes.
