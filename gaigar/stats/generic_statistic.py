        Computes the statistic based on the input genotype data.

        Parameters
        ----------
        **kwargs : dict
            Additional keyword arguments specific to the statistic being implemented.

        Returns

        Parameters
        ----------
        kwargs : dict
            Source mapping (typically the `**kwargs` passed to `compute`).
