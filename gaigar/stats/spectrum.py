    Spectrum statistic.

    Computes per-individual allele-frequency spectra (ArchIE-style i-ton)
    from a target population genotype matrix.

    Notes
    -----
    This implementation is stateless. Use `compute` as a static
    function; no instance initialization is required.

        """
        Computes per-individual frequency spectra for the target population.

        Parameters
        ----------
        tgt_gts : np.ndarray
            Genotype matrix of shape `(n_sites, n_samples)` for the target population.
        is_phased : bool
            If `True`, treat genotypes as phased haplotypes (effective ploidy = 1).
        ploidy : int
            Sample ploidy when `is_phased` is `False` (ignored otherwise).

        Returns
        -------
        dict
            A dictionary with a single key:
            `{"spectrum": np.ndarray}`, where the array has shape
            `(n_samples, n_bins)` and `n_bins = n_samples * ploidy + 1`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        tgt_gt : np.ndarray
