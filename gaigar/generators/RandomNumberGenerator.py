        Parameters
        ----------
        nrep : int
            The total number of repetitions to generate random numbers for.
        start_rep : int, optional

        seed : int, optional
            A global seed for the random number generator to ensure reproducibility across
            multiple runs. If not provided, random seeds will be generated without a fixed seed.
            Default is None.

        ------
        ValueError
